   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to TIPTOP's documentation!
==================================

In order to be able to easily predict the AO performance, we have developed
this fast algorithm producing the expected Adaptive Optics (AO see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics) Point Spread Function (PSF) for
any of the existing AO observing modes (Single-Conjugate-AO,
Laser-Tomographic-AO, Multi-Conjugate-AO, Ground-Layer-AO), and any atmospheric
conditions. This TIPTOP tool takes its roots in an analytical approach, where
the simulations are done in the Fourier domain. This allows to reach a very
fast computation time (few seconds per PSF with GPU acceleration), and
efficiently explore the wide parameter space.

.. note::
   This documentation is still under development. If you find confusing
   elements please open an issue on github and label it Documentation and assign 
   it to @alcheffot.  Also some heavy modification is to be expected in TIPTOP. 
   The documentation will try to follow.
