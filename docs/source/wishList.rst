Wish List
=========

* Fix the behaviour of the pixelScale/FieldOfView/numberoflenslet/sizeoflenslet
* adding the noise Variance computation for the pyramid in High Order
* Computation for low Orders for the pyramid. 
* Adding the center of gravity algorithms
* for sensor_LO change the NumberPhotons to nph/frame/subaperture to be consistent with HO.
* Fix the FieldOfView/PixelScale/NumberOfLenslet behaviour to something that makes sense.
* Discuss with Cedric the use of FieldOfView VS  WindowRadiusWCoG for LO sensor. Also the center of gravity algorithms
* NewValueThrPix: is this a really needed parameter or could we not parametrize this? 
* minimal parameter file example for configuring each of the type of AO
* AoArea other shapes than 'circle' and square



The matlab code works in spatial frequency domain.
pyramid from christoph verinaud, pyr responce goes from 0 to 1 
find 
umod line 279 fourrierModel.py
try to plot Sx in fourrier model. 
for the pyramid only use the high order part

test high order system 
extract the error breakdown from tiptop
