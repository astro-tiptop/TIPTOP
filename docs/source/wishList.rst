Wish List
=========

* Computation for low Orders for the pyramid. 
* minimal parameter file example for configuring each of the type of AO
* AoArea other shapes than 'circle' and 'square'
* Zenith and Azimuth: in ``[sources_science]`` and ``[sources_LO]`` they are required but optional in ``[sources_LO]``. Make this consistent : either all required or all optional.
