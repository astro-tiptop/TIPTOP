Wish List
=========

* Fix the behaviour of the pixelScale/FieldOfView/numberoflenslet/sizeoflenslet
* adding the noise Variance computation for the pyramid in High Order
* Computation for low Orders for the pyramid. 
* Adding the center of gravity algorithms
* for sensor_LO change the NumberPhotons to nph/frame/subaperture to be consistent with HO.
* Fix the FieldOfView/PixelScale/NumberOfLenslet behaviour to something that makes sense.
* Discuss with Cedric the use of FieldOfView VS  WindowRadiusWCoG for LO sensor. Also the center of gravity algorithms
* NewValueThrPix: is this a really needed parameter or could we not parametrize this? 
* minimal parameter file example for configuring each of the type of AO
